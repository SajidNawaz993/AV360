/**
 An otherwise vanilla subclass of UIPanGestureRecognizer used by AV360Player to enable manual camera panning.

 This class is exposed so that host applications can more easily configure interaction with other gesture
 recognizers, without having to refer to specific instances of an AV360Player gesture recognizer.
